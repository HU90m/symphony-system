# Symphony architecture specification

The Symphony architecture comprises a number of components:
- FPGA configuration architecture:
  What changes do we make to [Sonata](https://github.com/lowRISC/sonata-system), what changes to we make to [OpenTitan Earl Grey](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan) and how do we connect the two together?
  It defines everything we are using a hardware description language for.
- Software architecture:
  What toolchain, operating system and applications do we support?

Before we go into the architecture of the system, it is good to understand the use cases that we are envisioning, so that we can derive our architectural requirements from that.
